# bento-the-lunch-box

## Description

To assist busy parents with planning a variety of school lunches for the school week, we have developed an application which would allow them to select 4 items: sandwich, snack, fruit and drink for each meal. After creating 5 lunches, the application will allow the user/parent to see the 5 lunches for the week. 

## Installation

Product is a web-based application - no install required. (https://deetsb.github.io/bento-the-lunch-box/)

## Usage

Cycle through options in each of the 4 categories. Once your selections are made, click on the "Let's Make Lunch!" button to finalize your lunch.
