# bento-the-lunch-box

## Description

To assist busy parents with planning a variety of school lunches for the school week, we have developed an application which would allow them to select 4 items: sandwich, snack, fruit and drink for each meal. After creating 5 lunches, the application will allow the user/parent to see the 5 lunches for the week. 

## Table of Contents (Optional)

If your README is long, add a table of contents to make it easy for users to find what they need.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

## Badges

![badmath](https://img.shields.io/github/languages/top/lernantino/badmath)

Badges aren't necessary, per se, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
